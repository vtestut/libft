# Libft

Welcome to my Libft project! This project involves creating a library of essential C functions and additional functionalities.  

It is the very first project every student must do when joining 42 Paris and it is a fundamental part of the curriculum because we arn't alllowed to use most of the "main" C functions during the common core.

## Project Overview

The Libft project aims to strengthen our understanding of C programming, memory management, and the creation of a standard library. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

- **Part 1: Standard Functions**
  - Recreate essential functions from the standard C library (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, etc.).

- **Part 2: Additional Functions**
  - Implement additional utility functions to enhance your library.

- **Bonus: Linked List Functions**
  - Go beyond the basics by creating functions for manipulating linked lists.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files organized by functionality.
- **`/include/`:** Houses the header files, including `libft.h`.
- **`/tests/`:** Test your functions with various test cases.
- **`/bonus/`:** Additional functions for the bonus part.

## How to Use

Just run ./configure or 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the library using the provided Makefile (`make all`).
4. Link the library to your projects to utilize the functions.


Special thanks to Ecole 42 for the inspiration and learning opportunity.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
