# Libft

Welcome to my Libft project! This project, a fundamental part of the curriculum at Ecole 42, involves creating a library of essential C functions and additional functionalities.

## Project Overview

The Libft project aims to strengthen your understanding of C programming, memory management, and the creation of a standard library. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

- **Part 1: Standard Functions**
  - Recreate essential functions from the standard C library (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, etc.).

- **Part 2: Additional Functions**
  - Implement additional utility functions to enhance your library.

- **Bonus: Linked List Functions**
  - Go beyond the basics by creating functions for manipulating linked lists.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files organized by functionality.
- **`/include/`:** Houses the header files, including `libft.h`.
- **`/tests/`:** Test your functions with various test cases.
- **`/bonus/`:** Additional functions for the bonus part.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the library using the provided Makefile (`make all`).
4. Link the library to your projects to utilize the functions.
